### Table 01: Employee
- Column 1 is the employee ID, which is the primary key
    - It is generated by MD5 algorithm from the firstname, lastname, and passphrase.
    - This is generated on creation, but it is not edited.
- Column 2 is the employee's firstname.
- Column 3 is the employee's lastname.
- Column 4 is the employee's passphrase.

### Table 02: Expenses
- Column 1 is a serial primary key.
- Column 2 is the foreign key, which refers back to the primary key in *employee*.
    - It is not unique, because all expenses for a particular employee will be tracked by the employee ID.
- Column 3 is a label for the expense (string).
- Column 4 is the expense amount (numeric to 2 decimal places).
- Column 5 is the approval status of the expense (string: approved, denied, pending).
